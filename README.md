**TimeTravelInstitute.org** is the **“About Us” microsite** of the [Time Travel Institute](https://timetravelinstitute.com).  
While the `.com` hosts the active community and the `.net` hosts archives and research, the `.org` serves as a permanent record of **who we are, where we’ve been, and the people who made it possible**.

## 🌌 Purpose

The `.org` domain exists to document the legacy and evolution of the Time Travel Institute:

  An accessible narrative explaining the origins of TTI, its community, and its cultural significance.  

- **Snapshots from the Past**  
  Curated looks at TTI’s design and community through preserved [archive.org](https://archive.org/) snapshots.  

- **Timeline of Platforms**  
  A chronological record of the software stacks that powered TTI — from UBB.threads, to XenForo, to Discourse.  

- **Community Legends**  
  A tribute to past staff, moderators, and contributors who shaped the site and community.
